;=============================================================================================================================================================================
; Each line contains a single command;
; Commands and keywords are case insensitive
; There can be space or tabs in front of each command and between parameters;
; If the command has multiple parameters, you can assign values to them one by one in the format "parameter3=value3 parameter1=value1"; the parameter position does not matter.  
; If the command has only one parameter, you can assign the value of the parameter without put "keyword=parameter" in front of it. For example "siren 5" is equivalent to "siren duration=5"
; In "record" and "endrecord" command, the default interval is 10 in case you do not specify the value;
; Any commands after "cleanup", "quittest", "restarttest", or "reboot" will not be read and parsed;
; A empty line is acceptable, but it means nothing to the automation;
; Any words after ; or // are recognized as comments;
; It is highly recommended to begin the test with "synctmz" and "synctime";
; It is required to put a "batchtest start" command at the begging of any test case when you want to do triggers test; This will make other boxes to wait this box at "batch align" command;
; It is required to put a "batchtest align" command right begore trigger commands, which may align all the box before trigger test;
