;	7	checkfirmware 	version				check the CopTrax box's firmware version
;	8	checklibrary 	version				check the CopTrax Library version
;	9	batchtest 	mode				set the batch test mode to be start/align/stop
; 								When the mode is set to start, it will hold any other box to start triggers test until this box is aligned.
;								When the mode is set to align, it will hold this box to continue any further tests until all other boxes in batch test mode are aligned.
;								When the mode is set to stop, it will stop any later boxes to enter batch test align mode.
;								When envolving triggers test, you may have to put batchtest mode=start at the beginning, and to put batchtest mode=align right before any trigger commands.
;								One box can be aligned once in each test. An batchtest mode=stop is automatically assigned when the box get aligned.

; Each line contains a single command
; There can be space or tabs in front of each command and between parameters
; If the command has multiple parameters, you can assign values to them one by one in the format parameter3=value3 parameter1=value1; the parameter position does not matter.  
; If the command has only one parameter, you can assign the value of the parameter without put keyword=parameter in front of it. For example siren 5 is equivalent to siren duration=5
; In record and endrecord command, the default interval is 10 in case you do not specify the value 
; Any commands after cleanup, quittest, restarttest, or reboot will be eliminated.
; A empty line is acceptable, but it means nothing to the automation
; Any words after ; are recognized as comments
; It is highly recommended to begin the test with synctmz and synctime
; It is highly recommended to put stopapp before cleanup
; It is required to put a batchmode on before any triggers test
; begin the test with synctmz and synctime
; Sample test case
